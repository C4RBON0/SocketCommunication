# Communication with other device
 This 2 programs will enable us to communicate with another machine with sockets.
 A chat between them will be possible such as a walkie talkie, the main issue is that 
 we have to wait for the other response in order to say something else.
 To sum up, we can only send 1 message each per time, we cannot send 2, we have to wait
 for the response to say something else.

 I'd like to fix this in the future.

 How to use it:
 This has been made in visual studio code (anaconda), to run it we can simply run one of the files (client.py/server.py)
 and then spliting the terminal to run the other, "simulating" another device.
