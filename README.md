# Communication with other device
 This 2 programs will enable us to communicate with another machine with sockets.
 A chat between them will be possible such as a walkie talkie, the main issue is that 
 we have to wait for the other response in order to say something else.
 To sum up, we can only send 1 message each per time, we cannot send 2, we have to wait
 for the response to say something else.

 I'd like to fix this in the future.

 I tryed using it on another device but it isn't working as it should, even so it works in one device.

 How to use it:
 This has been made in visual studio code (anaconda), to run it we can simply run one of the files (client.py/server.py)
 and then spliting the terminal to run the other, "simulating" another device.
